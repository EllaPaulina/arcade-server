# NWJS 

This is the file `index.js`, you have to add it to the NWJS folder on the arcade cabinet.

<br><br>

The DOCS folder of this repository will be [served](https://hr-cmgt.github.io/arcade-server/) on the arcade cabinet at CMGT. The browser is [NWJS](http://docs.nwjs.io/en/latest/For%20Users/Getting%20Started/#get-nwjs) in Kiosk Mode.

Student games are also github repositories or other urls where their game is served.

The NWJS shortcut CTRL+A will always redirect from any game back to the main page. The NWJS folder of this repo contains the package.json and index.js files for NWJS. These files have to be placed on the actual arcade machine, with the Linux version of [NWJS](https://nwjs.io/downloads/).

### Updating NWJS and Chromium

Download the latest [NWJS](https://nwjs.io/downloads/) on ubuntu. Unzip and place all the files in the existing nwjs project. Do not remove/replace `index.js, app.js, bg.js`.
